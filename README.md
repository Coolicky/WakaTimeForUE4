# WakaTimeForUE4

Make sure you have Python, pip and wakatime installed and available from cmd/terminal.

You can get python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Installing pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Installing wakatime using pip: https://pypi.org/project/wakatime/

After you have all of these, the plugin should work just fine.
